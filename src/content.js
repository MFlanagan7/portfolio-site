        'Back end technologies are something I know a bit about, and I know how challenging and time consuming they can be to set up, integrate, troubleshoot and maintain.  I wanted a way to manage the different projects, blog posts, and general content I will create for my portfolio site.  Setting up a complete database and its functions and infrastructure would be an obstacle to my front end efforts for the site.  While getting a back end service setup is something I will add to the project in the near future, it would be great if I could get basic things like forms working without much thought toward back end functionality for the time being.  This is where Netlify shines.',
        'Netlify allows a whole host of back end features for developers without having to worry about what database to use, cloud services, or how to get around the dreaded CORS hurdle.  As I mentioned before, it even offers form handling with a single line of code.  Netlify offers a convenient dashboard that shows your form submissions, deployment statuses, hosting for different sites, and it even offers plugins.  One of the best features is integration with GitHub for automatic builds and deployment.  I am glad I discovered Netlify, and it will be a boon to many developers.',

        'My first experiences with React.js was pretty rewarding.  I see why it has become so popular.  It makes creating and maintaining larger projects a breeze and has a great experience for the developer.  Modular code and scalability are the core tenets of React and it shows.  The ability to create a component one time, and reuse it everywhere you need it is great, not to mention how styled components make CSS modular as well.  Keeping the CSS localized gives flexibility for designers to think primarily only about the component they are working with.',
        'That code modularity is where things get really interesting.  Once a component is developed, it can be reused forever without having to reinvent the wheel so to speak.  If your team has created a contact form component that has all the bells and whistles already built into it, why not use that whenever you need one instead of spending more manhours developing something from scratch.  To take it even further, what if you have already created a full landing page that takes in props and handles state well enough to make the entire landing page itself a component.  Its incredibly powerful.',
        'I cannot wait to dive deeper into React and I will definitely use it for many more projects to come.  I am already familiar with Node.js and have used Firebase for several projects before, but to add React on top of that will be a fun stack to work with.  Another stack I am eager to work with is MongoDB and Express.js.  There are many tools available to modern web developers, and they seem to continue to improve.  It is a good time to be a developer.',

        'Everyone faces challenges in their daily lives, but what separates successful people from others is the way they frame those challenges.  A failure is just finding out one more way of learning what works and what doesn’t.  This mindset can be applied to every part of life.  Deciding to grow and improve daily is the best decision you can make for yourself, and it will have positive impact in many other areas of your life; relationships, fitness, nutrition, learning new skills, just to name a few. ',
        'Consistent effort leads to consistent results.  If you make even the smallest of improvements every day, you will be amazed how quickly changes come.  Becoming 1% better at something is fairly insignificant on its own, but 1% better every day for 100 days is twice as good as when you started.  One percent isn’t much so it is doable in a single day.  Being consistent is where power lies.  Growing and improving daily and being consistent will transform any area of your life.',
